The information is now also more structured and easier to find.\\n\\nWe also hope that we will receive pull requests. ***Yes! You can help us improve the documentation***. It doesn\'t matter \\nif it is a small typo fix or a bigger change. We are happy about every contribution! Maybe you have a great idea for a \\nnew [example](/docs/category/examples), so that others can learn from it.\\n\\nBelow you see a `Edit this page` link, which will take you directly to the corresponding GitHub page of the \\ndocumentation."}]}')}}]);
