It was ok, but not really great to handle / look up certain\\nthings. We\'ve now moved to a new documentation platform called [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/).\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\nSince we are basing on Docusaurus many people will be familiar with the structure and looks\\nof the documentation. The information is now also more structured and easier to find.\\n\\nWe also hope that we will receive pull requests. ***Yes! You can help us improve the documentation***. It doesn\'t matter \\nif it is a small typo fix or a bigger change. We are happy about every contribution! Maybe you have a great idea for a \\nnew [example](/docs/category/examples), so that others can learn from it.\\n\\nBelow you see a `Edit this page` link, which will take you directly to the corresponding GitHub page of the \\ndocumentation."}]}')}}]);
