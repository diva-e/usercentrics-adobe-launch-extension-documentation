ðŸŽ‰ *It's live!* ðŸ¥³ We've revamped our documentation. We hope you like it!

:::tip Help wanted

We are ***open to contributions*** and are grateful for every GitHub pull request.

Before it was a PowerPoint presentation exported as a PDF. It was ok, but not really great to handle / look up certain
things. We've now moved to a new documentation platform called [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/).

<!--truncate-->

Since we are basing on Docusaurus many people will be familiar with the structure and looks
of the documentation. The information is now also more structured and easier to find.

We also hope that we will receive pull requests. ***Yes! You can help us improve the documentation***. It doesn't matter 
if it is a small typo fix or a bigger change. We are happy about every contribution! Maybe you have a great idea for a 
new [example](/docs/category/examples), so that others can learn from it.

Below you see a `Edit this page` link, which will take you directly to the corresponding GitHub page of the 
documentation.
